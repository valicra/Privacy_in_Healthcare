    "- A random node is elected to propose his block\n",
    "- Each other node verifies the content of the proposed block (coin is unspent, signatures are valid...)\n",
    "- the voting happens: if the majority of nodes accept the block this gets confirmed and appended to the blockchain. His hash value and memory address will be included in the next block. \n",

    "\n",
    "A solution for this isssue is the so called \"implicit consensus\". In this setting the voting is made by simply including the suggested block's hash in the next block. If node majority does this, the probability of building on the proposed block is very high and the opposite happens if the majority is not reached. An important note to add is that implicit consensus works if the probability of picking an honest node leader is greather than 50%. \n",

    "Consensus prevent double spending by trying to get rid of branches in the blockchain as much as possible. \n",
    "Whenever a double spending attack happens both transactions are kept alive and, eventually, included in blocks. The blockchain is continued on the block received first and after some time the block containing the second transaction is added to the blockchain. This is where a branch starts because the 2 blocks referes to the same previous block. Since we need to get rid of branches, we need to decide which block to keep and which to abandon and this is done using confirmations. So, we initially allow double spending, untill one of the two blocks reaches at least k confirmations. When this happens the creator of the \"good\" block gets his reward, while the \"bad\" (also called orphan) block gets eliminated from the blockchain, leaving his creator without reward. "
